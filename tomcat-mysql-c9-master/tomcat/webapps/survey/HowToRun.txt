Assume that 
  a. You have installed your Tomcat in "C:\tomcat6" and 
     your Tomcat uses HTTP port 8090.
  b. You have installed MySQL, put its BIN folder on your OS PATH,
     and your MySQL root password is "123456".
Otherwise you need to adjust the following instructions accordingly.
  
1. Copy file "survey.war" under your Tomcat's folder "webapps".
2. If Tomcat is not started yet, start your Tomcat service.
   A new project folder "survey" will be automatically created 
   under "...\webapps".
3. Open a Command Prompt window in "C:\tomcat6\webapps\survey".
   Run the following commands to create your survey database table 
   (you type text to the right of >): 
    survey> mysql  -uroot -p123456
    mysql> use test;
    mysql> source survey.sql;
    mysql> quit;
4. Start an IE window and visit "http://localhost:8090/survey/"
 
By default this project uses JSP pages for data submission, and servlets 
for data processing. The project deployment descriptor for this mixed use
of JSP and servlets is file "...\webapps\survey\WEB-INF\web.xml.servletJsp".
You can also run this project using JSP pages only. To do so you need to use
the contents of the JSP version project deployment descriptor 
"...\webapps\survey\WEB-INF\web.xml.jsp" to replace the contents of
 "...\webapps\survey\WEB-INF\web.xml";
the latter "web.xml" is the actual project deployment descriptor in use.

If your MySQL password is not "123456", you need to edit Java source code file
"...\survey\WEB-INF\classes\survey\DatabaseAccess.java", and recompile it.

If you change the contents of "web.xml" or Java files, 
you have to restart your Tomcat to have the changes to be in effect.

You are encouraged to compare the differences in JSP and servlet implementations of
the same functions. Not all files in this project folder are used at the same time.

        Suggested steps for develop a similar survey JSP project "studentSurvey"

1. Make a copy of folder "survey" in "webapps", and rename it as, say, "studentSurvey".
2. Choose your data to be collected, and design a graphic user interface with the basic 
   HTML form controls including text fields, combo boxes, text areas, and radio buttons. 
3. Revise the SQL statements in file "studentSurvey\survey.sql" for creating a database 
   table named "studentSurvey" for the data that you have chosen to be collected.
4. Open a Command Prompt window in "C:\tomcat6\webapps\studentSurvey", and run the 
   following commands to create your database table "studentSurvey" (you type text to 
   the right of  >): 

      > mysql  -uroot  –p123456
      mysql> use  test;
      mysql> source  survey.sql;
      mysql> quit;

5. In VM folder "studentSurvey\WEB-INF\classes\survey", revise file "Survey.java" so it 
   will have variables for the data fields of your choice and methods for saving and 
   retrieving these data into/from your database table studentSurvey.  You don’t need to 
   revise other Java files in this folder.
6. To compile the revised Java file, open a Command Prompt window and set its working 
   folder to be "studentSurvey\WEB-INF\classes". Type command "javac  survey/Survey.java". 
   Resolve any problems by revising the Java source file "Survey.java". Make sure that a 
   new file "WEB-INF\classes\survey\Survey.class" is created.
7. Use the JSP files in "studentSurvey" for reference, and revise them to implement your 
   project.
8. Make sure that the contents of file "WEB-INF\web.xml" is a copy of the contents of file
   "WEB-INF\web.xml.jsp", and then revise file "WEB-INF\web.xml" to support your project.
